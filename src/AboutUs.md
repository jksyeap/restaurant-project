description: Who We Are and What We Do
---
Four different people who were good at preparing four different types of food.
We decided it would be a good idea to start a restaurant which combined all of
these things, having a kitchen with four head chefs that would be in charge of
their own specialty.

Unfortunately that was a dumb idea since having four head chefs made for a 
kitchen where nothing got done and the restaurant quickly folded.

But now we're back and better than ever! We learned our lesson, and now we have
one head chef that just knows how to prepare all the dishes. Your food will no 
longer take a very long time to prepare, and will still be warm by the time it's
served!

And that's not all. We have the most beautiful beachside location in the state! 
So come on down, enjoy a great meal, and snap a great selfie that will make your
friends jealous.
