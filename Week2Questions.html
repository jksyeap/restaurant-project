        <li><img src="question1.png" alt="Screen Capture for Question 1"></li>

            <li><p>Use "code" as the selector. There are 106 of these elements.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Use "pre code" as the selector. There are 36 of these elements<br>
                 There are less of these elements because we have a condition<br>
                 that the "code" element must now be the child of a "pre" element,<br>
                 and not all "code" elements meet that condition.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Use "figure" as the selector. There are 5 of these elements.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Use "img" as the selector. There are 6 of these elements. This is<br>
                different from the above because "figure" is like a container for<br>
                visual content, and a "figure" might contain more than one "img".<br>
                The "img" is just an image.

            The DOM is the hierarchy in tree form that details the relationships between<br>
            elements, i.e. which elements are parents/children/siblings to which other<br>
            elements. The "html" element is at the root of the tree. Each node in the tree<br>
            can have associated attributes that help to select certain nodes or group<br>
            of nodes. The DOM is created from the source HTML, analogous to a parse<br>
            tree, but it might be different than the source because there are elements<br>
            that can be dynamically added through javascript, PHP, or some other method.
