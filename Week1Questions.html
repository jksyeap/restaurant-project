        What is the difference between the class attribute and the id attribute?

        <!-- Your answer here -->
        <p>
          The id attribute is unique to a page so only one element can have a particular id.<br>
          Many elements can share the same class attribute however.<br>

        <!-- Your question here -->
        What is the difference between external stylesheet, internal stylesheet, and inline styling?

      <section class="answer">
        <!-- Your answer here -->
        <p>
          Inline styling is using style tags in individual elements in the body.<br>
          Internal stylesheet is having a style tag in the head section that contains the css rules.<br>
          External stylesheet is using an external file for the css rules, the link to the file is in the head section.<br>
          Inline styling overrides internal and external stylesheets.<br>
          Internal stylesheet overrides external stylesheet if it comes after the link to the external stylesheet.<br>

      <header><h2>Website Structure Question 1</h2></header>
      <section class="question">
        <!-- Your question here -->
        Why is it better to use more descriptive elements like header and section instead of a bunch of divs or spans?
      </section>
      <section class="answer">
        <!-- Your answer here -->
        <p>
          It is better for organization and helping you keep track of what things should go where, it is also useful<br>
          for other people who may also be working on the page. Using the div or span by itself doesn't give any <br>
          information about what kind of content should be inside.<br>

      <section class="question">
        <!-- Your question here -->
        Give 3 elements that should be in the head section, and 3 that should be in the body section.
      </section>
      <section class="answer">
        <!-- Your answer here -->
        <p>
          The head section should contain meta data, so things like the doctype, the charset, and links to external css<br>
          files (and/or the internal stylesheet) or script files. The body contains the actual elements that will be <br>
          displayed on the page, so things like headers, main, sections, articles, and images will be here.<br>
